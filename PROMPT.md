Consider the docs of Talos, Kubespan, SST and Librechat. Create a folder with all Talos config, including the file to pass to the "talos.config" kernel parameter, so that the machine becomes part of a Kubespan-based Kubernetes cluster automatically. Then create the SST config, so that it accesses this Kubernetes cluster and deploys a Librechat instance based on its Helm chart. Note that this entire repo will later be published under https://github.com/divizend/root-infra.
